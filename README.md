## Disclaimer
This is just a modified version of [MultiGarmentNetwork](https://github.com/bharat-b7/MultiGarmentNetwork) github repository, made for running in python 3.x. Please visit the original repository for details.

# MultiGarmentNetwork
Repo for **"Multi-Garment Net: Learning to Dress 3D People from Images, ICCV'19"**

Link to paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06903

### Update 01 May 2020:
Added more garments here [Part-2](https://datasets.d2.mpi-inf.mpg.de/MultiGarmentNetwork/Multi-Garmentdataset_02.zip)

## Dress SMPL body model with our Digital Wardrobe

1. Download digital wardrobe: [Part-1](https://datasets.d2.mpi-inf.mpg.de/MultiGarmentNetwork/Multi-Garmentdataset.zip) and [Part-2](https://datasets.d2.mpi-inf.mpg.de/MultiGarmentNetwork/Multi-Garmentdataset_02.zip).
This dataset contains scans, SMPL registration, texture_maps, segmentation_maps and multi-mesh registered garments.

2. visualize_scan.py: Load scan and visualize texture and segmentation.

3. visualize_garments.py: Visualize random garment and coresponding SMPL model.

4. dress_SMPL.py: Load random garment and dress desired SMPL body with it.


## Pre-requisites for running MGN
The code has been tested in python 2.7, Tensorflow 1.13

Download the neutral SMPL model from http://smplify.is.tue.mpg.de/ and place it in the `assets` folder.
```
cp <path_to_smplify>/code/models/basicModel_neutral_lbs_10_207_0_v1.0.0.pkl assets/neutral_smpl.pkl
```

Download and install DIRT: https://github.com/pmh47/dirt.

Download and install mesh packages for visualization: https://github.com/MPI-IS/mesh

This repo contains code to run pretrained MGN model.
Download saved weights from : https://datasets.d2.mpi-inf.mpg.de/MultiGarmentNetwork/weights.zip

## Data preparation

If you want to process your own data, some pre-processing steps are needed:

1. Crop your images to 720x720. In our testing setup we used roughly centerd subjects at a distance of around 2m from the camer.
2. Run semantic segmentation on images. We used [PGN semantic segmentation](https://github.com/Engineering-Course/CIHP_PGN) and manual correction. Segment garments, Pants (65, 0, 65), Short-Pants (0, 65, 65), Shirt (145, 65, 0), T-Shirt (145, 0, 65) and Coat (0, 145, 65).
3. Run [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) body_25 for 2D joints.

Semantic segmentation and OpenPose keypoints form the input to MGN. See `assets/test_data.pkl` folder for sample data.

## Texture

The following code may be used to stitch a texture for the reconstruction: https://github.com/thmoa/semantic_human_texture_stitching
